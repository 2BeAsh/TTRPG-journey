# TTRPG-journey
Analysis of TTRPG player behaviour. 


# What insights do I hope to gain (Core research question)?
*How do tabletop RPG players progress from their first game to the present day, and what common lifepaths exist in the hobby?*

## Secondary questions:
- Hobby Gateway-games: What games introduce people to the hobby?
- Game specific gateway-games: Are there some games which people usually only play if they played another game (e.g., D&D 3e -> PF1 or D&D5e -> Draw Steel)
- Do players tend to stick with a single system or branch out?
- Hubs and magnets: Are there some games which lead to many other games ("hubs"), and conversely, some games which people end up playing forever ("magnets")

## Outcome:
Would be fun to have people do the questionnaire later be able to get a suggested new game or something like that.


# Things to look out for
**Hypothesis**: A large fraction of the people engaging in online discussion on TTRPGs do not play any games. 
This analysis *does not* want to include these only-online community members. 


**Problem**: It is hard to say specifically which game leads to the next. Starting game is easy, but from then, what? A question like "List the games you have played in chronological order" may not give a good insight, and I could imagine people not bothering to answer a question like that which requires more thought than simply "What was you first rpg game?". 


# Things to investigate

## Public data
- Large convention table reservations (gauge how many people actually play)
- Book sales over time 
- Indirect measures (all of these are much more likely to be online-only members) 
    - YouTube views on TTRPG videos 
    - Live play views on Twitch
    - Forum post engagement per game (e.g., track number of Reddit posts in r/dragonbane)


## Questionnaires
Would be interesting to track if different sub-communities answer differently, i.e., if a questionare on r/dndnext gets different responses than r/rpg or r/osr.

### Where to send questionnaires
- Discord communities:
    - Draw Steel
    - Quinn's Quest
    - Better Monsters (Isaac)
    - Official dnd?
    - Pathfinder?
- Subreddits:
    - r/drawsteel
    - r/osr
    - r/dndnext
    - r/rpg
    - r/shadowdark
- Facebook communities:
    - Find some big ones. 

Generally, just try and find the most popular ttrpg communities, but also some more niche game to get a broader sample
Would be interesting to see if people who play less popular games behave differently.

### Questions:
- What introduced you to the hobby?
    - Friends/family
    - Online videos of people playing
    - Other online content (memes etc.)
    - Stranger Things
- When did you last play/run a ttrpg game?
